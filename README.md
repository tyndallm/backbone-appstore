# Simple App Store - Sample Application using Node.js and Backbone.js

Backbone App Store is a simple app store application built with Node.js, Backbone.js, Express, Twitter Bootstrap, MongoDB, Mongoose.js, and Passport.js

This application allows you to display a list of apps as well as filter, view details, add new apps, and remove apps.

I built this application while trying to learn Node.js and Backbone.js.  The entire technology stack includes:
* Node.js
* Backbone.js
* Express.js
* Twitter Bootstrap
* MongoDB
* Mongoose.js
* Passport.js
